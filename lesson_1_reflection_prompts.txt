How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that

was introduced?

    

it compared the two files and laid out the differences clearly.
we need not compare the two files manually
simply scanning through the contents that have changed helped in identifying the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

efficient programmer in the long term?

    

it would make it easier to undo changes to the code
revert back to an earlier version of the file
makes debugging easier
saves time wasted in comparing long lines of code




What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

docs does?



in git manually choosing when to commit, is actaully more flexible.
we can commit as per our convenience and also we can commit in such way that 
each commit reflects a logical change.
we can make sure its neither  too big or too small
cons of this method would be forgeting to commit or improper commiting
strategies
unlike these in systems like google docs commit is done often an it is mot flexible
history might get cluttered
it is useful for people who are forgetful
    


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


    
git is mainly for tracking versions of code
in files containing codes , changes to one file may affect another
so keep track of all of them these features provided by git are essential
but on the other hand goole docs simply saves documents where changes to one file
may not affect other



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

git log gives the history of all commits
git diff compares them to give the changes


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that 
could break something?

    

even if we make channges that introduces bugs , we can revert back to 
an older versions using git checkout and find exactly where the bug was introduced
and resolve it. since bugs can be fixed it makes us more cofident




Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
